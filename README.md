Risk AI Trainer & Game Framework

Overview

This program allows users to train their own DQN AI models for playing Risk or use pre-trained models supplied. It provides a user-friendly interface for AI training and gameplay, serving as a framework for developing and testing Risk AI. There are multiple types of AI that can be trained using this general framework, but this implementation only does DQN (Deep Q-Learning). And a good amount of effort making it play in a not horrible way. There is a GUI built in and I tried to make it easy to use.

Thanks for checking it out
