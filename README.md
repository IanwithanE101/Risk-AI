Risk AI Trainer & Game Framework

Overview

This program allows users to train their own AI models for playing Risk or use pre-trained models supplied. It provides a user-friendly interface for AI training and gameplay, serving as a framework for developing and testing Risk AI. There are multiple types of AI that can be trained. And a good amount of effort making it play in a not horrible way. There is a GUI built in and i tried to make it easy to use.

Thanks for checking it out
